# complex
Here you can find my sketches about complex analysis. 

Visit https://jcponce.github.io/ to play with them.

I also discovered recently https://cindyjs.org/ and I am learning to use it. I have adapted some applets and now I am putting them in this repository. Some examples are:

Domain coloring: https://jcponce.github.io/complex/domcoloring/

Analytic landscape v1: https://jcponce.github.io/complex/dclandscape/

Analytic lanscape v2: https://jcponce.github.io/complex/analyticlandscape/

Taylor series: https://jcponce.github.io/complex/taylorseries/

Finally, one that I made, Power functions: https://jcponce.github.io/complex/powerfunction/
