Here you can find my sketches about complex analysis. 

Visit [Dynamic Mathematics](https://jcponce.github.io/) to play with them.

I recently discovered [Cindy.js](https://cindyjs.org/) and I am learning to use it. I have adapted some applets and now I am putting them in this repository. Some examples are:

[Domain coloring](https://jcponce.github.io/complex/domcoloring/)

[Analytic landscape v1](https://jcponce.github.io/complex/dclandscape/)

[Analytic landscape v2](https://jcponce.github.io/complex/analyticlandscape/)

[Taylor series](https://jcponce.github.io/complex/taylorseries/)

Here is one that I made about [Power functions](https://jcponce.github.io/complex/powerfunction/)

## Complex function plotter

I have been learning about shaders. Here is an experiment about complex mapping and domain coloring
