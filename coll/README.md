# Collision Detection

**View the book, including interactive examples: [jeffreythompson.org/collision-detection](http://www.jeffreythompson.org/collision-detection)**

> **UPDATE!** This site has been getting lots of visits which is awesome. I've made some changes so it will look better on mobile devices, make navigation easier, and tried to look over everything for mistakes. If you have any problems or suggestions, please [post an issue on the project repository](https://github.com/jeffThompson/CollisionDetection/issues). Thanks!

The collision of objects underlies most game experiences and user-interfaces. Baseball bats collide with balls, zombies bump into walls, and Mario lands on platforms and stomps turtles. Even something as simple as clicking a button (a rectangle) with your mouse (a point) is a collision.

This book explains the algorithms behind those collisions using basic shapes like circles, rectangles, and lines so you can implement them into your own projects.

#### WHAT'S COVERED HERE?
This book covers collisions between points, circles, rectangles, lines, polygons, and triangles. These examples are meant to be as readable and easily understood as possible. There are definitely faster, more efficient ways to detect these collisions, but this book is intended to be friendly and teach the principles with minimal math.

Each section include a description of the collision algorithm and an interactive example built using `processing.js`.

#### WHAT'S NOT?  
As with any book, there's a lot more useful material than could be covered here. Things that aren't discussed are mostly left out because the math gets too complicated. Three-dimensional space isn't touched on. Ellipses, which seem like they should be pretty easy, are actually very difficult.

If there's a specific collision not covered that would be helpful, please please [submit an issue with a request](https://github.com/jeffThompson/CollisionDetection/issues) or, better yet, submit a working example that you've built!

#### ISSUES?  
If you find code that doesn't run correctly, an algorithm that isn't explained quite right, or a typo, please [report them](https://github.com/jeffThompson/CollisionDetection/issues). Thanks for your help!

**But you're free to use the ideas and code from this book *inside* your projects,** so long as this is just a part of what you're working on. In other words: you're welcome to build a super cool game that relies on the code you've seen here, even if you're going to sell it!

#### WHAT YOU SHOULD ALREADY KNOW  
This book's examples are written in [Processing](http://www.processing.org), a wrapper for the Java programming language. While you need only a little programming experience, you should understand how a basic Processing sketch is structured, how to use variables, how to draw shapes and get input from the mouse, and how `if/else` statements work. It may be helpful to understand using `PVector` objects to store positions, but we'll cover the basics if you haven't used them before.

At the end, we will talk about using collision in object-oriented code. Understanding object-oriented programming will not be required to use this book, but it will be helpful for using these topics in larger projects with lots of objects hitting each other.
