<h4>SECTION 1</h4>

<h1>CHALLENGES</h1>

<p>Try these challenge prompts to modify the code we've written. Don't get frustrated if you can't figure them all out &mdash; some are intended for more experienced programmers:</p>

<p><ol>
	<li>Try changing the colors of the objects when they collide. Hint: look in the <code>draw()</code> section for the <code>fill()</code> command.</li>
	<li>Can you make something else interesting happen when collision occurs? Objects change size, move across the screen, etc?  </li>
	<li>Our <a href="point-point.php">Point/Point</a> collision is very finicky: you have to be in the <em>exact</em> location of the other point for the collision to trigger. Can you modify the code to include a "buffer zone" where collision happens, even if the two points aren't actually touching?  </li>
</ol></p>
