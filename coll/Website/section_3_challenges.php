<h1>CHALLENGES</h1>

<p>Try these challenge prompts to modify the code we've written:</p>

<p><ol>
	<li><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=cat+lasers&amp;sa=X&amp;biw=970&amp;bih=818&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;ei=A5hXVb7mCcWwsAT0rYGoCA&amp;ved=0CB4QsAQ">Lasers!</a> Can you build a simple game where the player uses the mouse to navigate an array of lasers and get to the other side of a room? Draw your character as a simple circle or rectangle, or replace them with an image but test the collision as a bounding circle or box.  </li>
	<li>Using <a href="line-circle.php">Line/Circle</a> collision, we can simulate a ball bouncing off an angled surface. Can you add gravity, plus make the circle bounce off in a direction based on the angle of the line? Hint: to get the bounce direction, get the angle between the ball and the closest point on the line. For this, you can use Processing's <code>angleBetween()</code> function.</li>
