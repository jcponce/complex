<h1 style="font-size:2.5em">WHERE ARE THE OTHER TRIANGLE EXAMPLES?</h1>

<p>You might be wondering where all the other triangle collision examples are. The answer: we've already made them! The smallest number of sides a polygon can have is three, so all the polygon code will work for triangles too.</p>

<p>However, since our polygon code is meant to work with PVectors, you will need to define your triangles using three PVector objects, or modify the collision functions.</p>
