# Introduction
            
Domain coloring is a method that allows us to represent complex functions by assigning a color
to each point of the complex plane. The method involves basically two main ideas:

1. Assign a color to every point in the complex plane.
2. Color the domain of f by painting the location z with the color determined by the value f(z).

It is common to use the color wheel because it is easy to match the HUE values with the phase (argument) of a complex number z which is usually defined in the interval [0,2\pi), or (-\pi, \pi].

To implement this method in the computer consider a rectangular region of pixels on
the screen. This will be a discretized domain D_h for the function f. Every pixel i is
identified with a complex number z_i where f is evaluated. Then calculate
the phase of the value f(z) and its corresponding color. Finally assign the resulting
color to that pixel. This procedure is shown in the animation below.

# Basic set up

In this project I used [p5.js](https://p5js.org/). At the begining I had only one function for plotting one color scheme but later I realized that it was better to have a class to include other color schemes: 

* [domainColoring class](https://github.com/jcponce/complex/blob/gh-pages/dctools/libraries/domainColoring.js)

This class also requieres a complex function parser and the library for the HSLuv color scheme.

* [Complex parser](https://github.com/jcponce/complex/blob/gh-pages/dctools/libraries/Complex.min.js)
* [HSLuv](https://github.com/jcponce/complex/blob/gh-pages/dctools/libraries/hsluvmin.js)

To set it up in p5.js you must include in the index file the class and the other two libraries, including your sketch file:

    <script src="hsluvmin.js"></script>
    <script src="Complex.min.js"></script>
    <script src="domainColoring.js"></script>
    <script src="sketch.js"></script>
    
In the sketch file define within the setup function the class 'domanColoring(func, size)' with two parameters:
- func: a complex function (as a string) e.g. 'z^2',
- size: a real number > 0 e.g. 6.

Thus we have

    let domC; 
    let fn = 'z^2'; // Change this function
    let s = 6; // Change this size
    function setup() {
      // It looks better when the canvas is a square, min 400x400
      createCanvas(500, 500);
      pixelDensity(1);
  
      // Domain coloring setting
      domC = new domainColoring(fn, s); 
    }
        
Now we just need to plot it using one of the following options defined within our class:

- plotHSV(opt)
  - opt: 'Phase', 'Modulus', 'Phase/Modulus', 'None'
- plotHSVDisc(opt)
  - opt: 'Phase', 'Modulus', 'Phase/Modulus', 'None'
- plotHSL(opt)
  - opt: 'Phase', 'Modulus', 'Phase/Modulus', 'Standard', 'None'
- plotRGB(opt)
  - opt: 'Phase', 'Modulus', 'Phase/Modulus', 'None'
- plotHSVReIm(opt)
  - opt: 'Real', 'Imaginary', 'Re/Im', 'Modulus', 'All', 'None'
- plotHSLuv(opt, minHue, maxHue)
  - opt: 'Phase', 'Modulus', 'Phase/Modulus', 'None'
  - minHue: 0
  - maxHue: 1
- plotBW(opt),
   - opt: 'Phase', 'Modulus', 'Phase/Modulus', 'Real', 'Imaginary', 'Re/Im'
- plotHSVG()   

For example, let's use plotHSV(opt):

    function draw() {
      domC.plotHSV('Modulus');
    }

## About the HSV (or HSB) color scheme

The method I used for the HSV (or HSB) color scheme is based on [Elias Wegert](http://www.visual.wegert.com/)'s work from his book [Visual Complex Functions.](http://www.springer.com/de/book/9783034801799) He basically employs phase portraits with contour lines of phase and modulus, *enhanced phase portraits*, for the study of the theory of complex functions. I also added extra color schemes to explore different ways to visualize complex functions. In particular, I used some of the equations discussed in the *MATHEMATICA &amp; Wolfram Language* section from the *Stack Exchange* site:
