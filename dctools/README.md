# Domain coloring plotting tools

Hi! Welcome. Here are the sketches about domain coloring for visualizing complex functions.

#### Introduction

The method I used here is based on Elias Wegert's work from his book [Visual Complex Functions.](http://www.springer.com/de/book/9783034801799) He basically employs phase portraits with contour lines of phase and modulus *enhanced phase portraits* for the study of the theory of complex functions. I also added extra color schemes to explore different ways to visualize complex functions.

I recommend you also the following resources with different programming languages: 

* [Complex Color Map](https://github.com/endolith/complex_colormap)
* [C-plot](https://github.com/nschloe/cplot)

#### Most recent update
I was able to work out how to add a parser for complex functions. Now you can easily input a function such as 'f(z)=z^2+cos(z)'.
