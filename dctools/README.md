# Domain coloring plotting tools

Hi! Welcome. Here are the sketches about domain coloring for visualizing complex functions.

#### Introduction

The method I used here is based on Elias Wegert's work from his book [Visual Complex Functions.](http://www.springer.com/de/book/9783034801799) He basically employs phase portraits with contour lines of phase and modulus, *enhanced phase portraits*, for the study of the theory of complex functions. I also added extra color schemes to explore different ways to visualize complex functions. In particular, I used some of the equations discussed in the *MATHEMATICA &amp; Wolfram Language* section from the *Stack Exchange* site:

[How can I generate this “domain coloring” plot?](https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/questions/7275/how-can-i-generate-this-domain-coloring-plot)

In this project I used [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) but there are similar projects or online plotters using other programming languages: 

* [Complex Color Map](https://github.com/endolith/complex_colormap)
* [C-plot](https://github.com/nschloe/cplot)
* [Domain Coloring](https://github.com/fogleman/domaincoloring)
* [The Complex Grapher](https://talbrenev.com/complexgrapher/)
* [Complex Function Grapher](http://jutanium.github.io/ComplexNumberGrapher/)
* [Conformal Map Viewer](http://davidbau.com/archives/2013/02/10/conformal_map_viewer.html)
* [Exploring complex function](https://cindyjs.org/gallery/cindygl/ComplexExplorer/index.html)

Visit [Domain coloring](https://jcponce.github.io/domain-coloring) to play with the different tools I made or if you prefer you can visit the [Domain Coloring Gallery](https://www.dynamicmath.xyz/domain-coloring/dcgallery.html).

I also recommend you the following galleries:

* [Phase Plot Gallery](http://www.mathe.tu-freiberg.de/~wegert/PhasePlot/images.html)
* [Gallery of Complex Functions](https://vqm.uni-graz.at/pages/complex/index.html)

#### Updates

Feb-2019: Added Complex library.

May-2019: Added more color schemes.

Sep-2019: I was able to work out how to add a parser for complex functions thanks to [David Bau's work](http://davidbau.com/). Now you can easily input a function such as 'f(z)=z^2+cos(z)'.
